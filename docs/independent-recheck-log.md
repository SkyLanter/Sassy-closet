# Independent recheck log

This file is the running log for the independent recheck lane. The author of this log did not build the pull requests it records. Nothing here is a merge, a deploy, or a live write.

Window: through 2026-11-07 00:00 America/Los_Angeles.

Rules for this lane: comment on the reviewed PR only, never push to another branch, never merge, close, approve, or mark ready, and never write Blob, KV, or Meta.

A row is rechecked only at the head SHA in that row. A later push needs a new run. `INDEPENDENT RECHECK PASS` or `FAIL` is posted on the PR after `npm ci` in both apps and `scripts/hard_recheck.sh --base origin/main` with no skip flags, plus an adversarial read of the diff.

## 2026-11-02 22:20 UTC — queue opened

Open drafts from #217 up, combined #225 first. No open pull request matched a knowledge-lane docs title at this snapshot. Older learn-track drafts (#19–#41 and similar) are outside this queue unless a new knowledge-lane PR opens.

#222 and #239 were still running at this tick. #223, #224, #226–#231, and #240–#247 are still queued on the existing workers. No knowledge-lane docs PR. New drafts #250–#258 are queued below. #249 is this log and is not graded.

## 2026-11-02 23:15 UTC — new drafts

| PR | Head | Title |
| --- | --- | --- |

This log lives on draft PR #249 (`cursor/independent-recheck-log-cfee`). That PR is this lane's own notes, so this lane does not grade it.

PR watch subscriptions for #217–#247 expire 2026-11-05 22:28 UTC. Renew them before then so the loop still reaches 2026-11-07 00:00 America/Los_Angeles. A 45-minute timer is also set.

Early static notes, not verdicts:

- None of these diffs change `data/held.json` or a CSS file.
- #232 adds a pull-request workflow that runs the hard recheck with read-only contents permission. It does not deploy.
- #239 adds a manual workflow that GETs live shop and intake documents and aborts non-document and `/api/` requests. It does not deploy. This lane will not run that live smoke.
- #218 fails a configured Blob read closed (no seed) and drops another mã's held folder from image URLs. A primary socket error can still read the legacy blob path `sassy-closet-shop/catalog.json`; that path is an explicit tested fallback, not a seed fallback.
- #219 stops intake save from filling a blank sell with a calculated price. A typed zero still stores a zero. This is an intake field change, not an S06 catalog edit.
